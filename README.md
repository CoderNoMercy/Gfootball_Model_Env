# Gfootball_Model_Env

I design a new method in reinforcement learning. It is still under test. If you are interested in my thought, take some trials using the repo

# What to do
-[ ] implement this algorithm in other game and compare this method with other method
-[ ] leverage its computation cost and analyze its convergence rate
